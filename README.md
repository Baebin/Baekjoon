## 1. Reason for writing
- This is a repository created for self-development.
- I am going to continue to “Solve the Baekjoon Problems step by step”.
- So I will try different languages to improve my programming abilities.
- Please point out any problems or let me know if you have better code. (Always welcome ^^)
